	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: The availability and utilization of {MRI} units across sub-Saharan Africa countries remain poor and its distribution is largely unknown. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to determine the distribution and utilization of {MRI} facilities across the West African sub-region. {METHODS}: An interview and online search survey was conducted from September 2015 to September 2016, to determine the {MRI} facilities (Government/Public and Private) available in the West African sub-region. In Nigeria and Ghana, face-to-face interviews were conducted while for other West African countries, telephone interviews with radiologists and other health professionals as well as a Google online search were conducted to ascertain the distribution of the {MRI} facilities in the region. The number of {MRI} units in West Africa per million population was calculated and compared with other parts of the world from available published data. {RESULTS}: Eighty-four {MRI} units serve a combined population of 372,551,411 in the West African sub-region at the time of this report. Nigeria accounted for more than two-thirds (58 (69\%)) of the available units. Of these, 45 (77.6\%) of the units were low-field strength systems. Ghana's 14 {MRI} units were fairly equally distributed between the private (57\%) and the public sectors (43\%). Ghana with 0.48 units/million population had the highest number of {MRI} units/million population followed by Nigeria with 0.30 units/million population. {CONCLUSION}: Though there is an increase in the number of available {MRI} units in the West African sub region in the last decade, the numbers remain appallingly small for the population. Infrastructural and maintenance limitations constitute a major impediment to the use of high filed systems in the region. There may be need for greater cooperation between public and private enterprises for future improvement of {MRI} utilization in the region.},

	abstract = {The role of {MRI} in diagnostics, prognostics, and discoveries in basic sciences has been well established. However, access to this life-saving technology is largely restricted to countries in upper-middle to high-income groups. In this article, we collate recent global {MR} scanner density data and group them into six geographical regions based on the {WHO} classification. We then analyze these data with respect to demographic factors such as population size, life expectancy, the percentage of internet users, and World Bank income grouping. We map these demographic factors to five dimensions or characteristics of accessible {MRI}, adapting definitions from the healthcare literature. With this background, the study then reviews recent demonstrations of accessible {MRI} categorized based on main magnetic field strength. We describe demonstrated examples for each of these categories, ranging from ultralow-field to ultrahigh-field {MRI}. Lastly, we review {MR} methods and associated developments impacting accessible {MRI} such as increasing/augmenting {MR} awareness and local expertise, incorporating hardware-cognizant methods, rapid quantitative imaging, and leveraging innovations from adjacent fields.

	abstract = {A magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) simulator, which reproduces {MRI} experiments using computers, has been developed using two graphic-processor-unit ({GPU}) boards ({GTX} 1080). The {MRI} simulator was developed to run according to pulse sequences used in experiments. Experiments and simulations were performed to demonstrate the usefulness of the {MRI} simulator for three types of pulse sequences, namely, three-dimensional (3D) gradient-echo, 3D radio-frequency spoiled gradient-echo, and gradient-echo multislice with practical matrix sizes. The results demonstrated that the calculation speed using two {GPU} boards was typically about 7 {TFLOPS} and about 14 times faster than the calculation speed using {CPUs} (two 18-core Xeons). We also found that {MR} images acquired by experiment could be reproduced using an appropriate number of subvoxels, and that 3D isotropic and two-dimensional multislice imaging experiments for practical matrix sizes could be simulated using the {MRI} simulator. Therefore, we concluded that such powerful {MRI} simulators are expected to become an indispensable tool for {MRI} research and development.},
